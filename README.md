Some usefull scripts for your everyday needs
============================================

This is a little collection of some scripts I wrote to save some time. 

start, stop, restart
--------------------
Scripts to start, stop, restart services on a gentoo-based system (rc-config) via sudo. 

*TIP*: put this in your sudoers file: 
    %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rc-config
